# Best Practices for Securing Remote Login Process and Password Management in the organization
1- Change Default Options 
Never install or configure new program or application with the default options
They are common knowledge in most environments so it can be used as advantage for attacker.
like : Change default port , Disable root login and  Limiting SSH access for specific users greatly enhances security.

2- Enforcement users' passwords to be +12 uncommon Characters to make Bruteforce attacks as impossible as it could be.

3- Configure second factor authentication for SSH:
That will ensure the system admins any successful login is more than single credential
which is more secure than a password or SSH key alone.

4- Authenticate clients using SSH certificates:
Although SSH key-based authentication is a better alternative to passwords
SSH certs secure the login process by using public keys while also providing 
a certificate to verify each keyâ€™s identity. 
OpenSSH has a built-in way to generate certificates using ssh-keygen

5- Implement whitelist for firewalls:
enable only the trusted connections and destinations you already know 
and block/drop all other attempts.

6- Rotational passwords enforcement
Make sure to make an expire cycle for passwords created on the system 
to enforce users to change them every period.
